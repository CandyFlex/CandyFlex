Ten years running Elusive Designs — freelance web dev for small businesses. WordPress, WooCommerce, hosting, graphic design, whatever they needed. Somewhere around a hundred clients. Before that, overnight shifts at a network operations center.

Now I'm building full-stack applications with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma. Learning by making things I'd actually use instead of following someone's todo app tutorial for the fortieth time. The projects ended up being tools for tabletop RPG game masters, because I kept finding problems nobody had solved yet.

## The ones worth looking at

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| :crossed_swords: | **[Saga](https://github.com/CandyFlex/saga)** · [demo](https://saga-app-nine.vercel.app) | Campaign tracker. 19 API endpoints, 8-tab interface, PWA. Characters, sessions, timelines, dice, initiative. The most complete project here. |
| :spider_web: | **[Intrigue](https://github.com/CandyFlex/intrigue)** · [demo](https://intrigue-app.vercel.app) | NPC relationship mapper. Interactive D3.js network graph. Factions, alliances, secrets. Probably the most technically interesting one. |
| :studio_microphone: | **[Voicecraft](https://github.com/CandyFlex/voicecraft)** | NPC voice profiles. Every DM has the problem where all their NPCs sound the same. Dialect mixing, coaching prompts, sample lines. |

## Still cooking

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| :hammer_and_pick: | **[Loreforge](https://github.com/CandyFlex/loreforge)** | Worldbuilding prompts. 30 across 6 categories. No AI, just structure. |
| :scroll: | **[Oath](https://github.com/CandyFlex/oath)** | Session zero wizard. Tone, safety tools, house rules. |
| :world_map: | **[Outlands](https://github.com/CandyFlex/outlands)** | Hex crawl map editor. Paint terrain, drop encounters, run exploration. |
| :balance_scale: | **[Favor](https://github.com/CandyFlex/favor)** | Faction reputation tracker. Heatmap grid so you know where everyone stands. |

System-agnostic. D&D, Pathfinder, Mothership, homebrew, whatever.

---

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| :crab: | **[Pinch](https://github.com/CandyFlex/pinch)** | Claude usage monitor for Windows. Taskbar pill that goes green/yellow/red. Nothing to do with D&D — just got tired of hitting rate limits blind. |

<summary>Background</summary>
<br>

Started in IT — overnight shifts at a network operations center. Hardware installs, structured cabling, infrastructure monitoring.

Then ten years of Elusive Designs. WordPress, WooCommerce, hosting, design. Hundred-something clients, full lifecycle — scoping, building, maintaining, answering the phone when something broke at 11pm.

The modern stack is new. The problem-solving isn't.
