# Jarred Kern

**Design. Development. Product.**

</div>

I design things, I build them, and then I ship them.

Ten years running Elusive Designs — freelance web dev and branding for small businesses. WordPress, WooCommerce, brand identities, hosting, graphic design, whatever they needed. Somewhere around a hundred clients. The design side was always what pulled me in. Before that, overnight shifts at a network operations center.

Now I'm designing and building full-stack products from scratch. React, Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma. Each project starts as a design problem, then I build the whole thing. The projects ended up being tools for tabletop RPG game masters, because I kept finding problems nobody had designed a good solution for.

## Projects

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| :crossed_swords: | **[Saga](https://github.com/CandyFlex/saga)** · [demo](https://saga-app-nine.vercel.app) | Campaign tracker for tabletop RPGs. 8 interconnected views, 19 API endpoints, PWA. The most complete thing I've built. |
| :studio_microphone: | **[Voicecraft](https://github.com/CandyFlex/voicecraft)** | NPC voice profiles. Mixer interface for something with no established UI pattern. Dialect coaching, sample lines. |
| :candle: | **[Pinch](https://github.com/CandyFlex/pinch)** | Claude usage monitor for Windows. Taskbar pill that goes green/yellow/red. Nothing to do with D&D — just got tired of hitting rate limits blind. |

<summary>Background</summary>
<br>

Started in IT — overnight shifts at a network operations center. Hardware installs, structured cabling, infrastructure monitoring.

Then ten years of Elusive Designs. WordPress, WooCommerce, hosting, brand identities, graphic design. Hundred-something clients, full lifecycle — from the logo to the checkout page to the DNS records.

My resume reads more like a map than a ladder. That's the whole skill.
